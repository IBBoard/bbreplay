* Handle more command types (if required)
* Load team rosters
* Map player indexes to roster numbers/players
* Fill in missing players on setup (default places in standard "attract centre" formation?)
* Match log entries up with commands
* Create flow of "events" based on commands and entries
  (e.g. command says move three but one was a dodge that failed)
  * Track board state
  * Calculate when a move needs a dodge
  * Include other effects (Tentacles prevent dodgeâ€¦ anything else?)
  * Include negating effects (Stupid/Bone-head/prone/stunned lose tackle zone)
* Check how some skills are represented in commands/logs:
    * Sidestep
    * Ball and Chain
    * Shadow
    * Leap
    * Kick-Off Return
    * Diving Catch
    * Diving tackle
    * Pass Block
    * Throw Team-Mate
    * Leader and Pro re-rolls
